# E-commerce-Backend

Successfully completed a project involving the development of a full-stack e-commerce application. 
The project comprised a Spring Boot back-end utilizing REST APIs and a MySQL database, along with an Angular front-end. 


The primary functionality of the application was centered around a shopping cart feature, 
enabling users to view a list of products, add or remove items from their cart (CRUD operations), 
and proceed with the checkout process.
